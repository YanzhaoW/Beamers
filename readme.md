# Presentation slides using Beamer/Latex

This repository contains my presentation sides for the past conferences and meetings. All slides are generated by the Beamer/Latex due to its superiority at:

- Macro configurations
- Better arrangement of texts and pictures
- Much better integration to git/github
- Works on all operating systems (Bye Bye Windows!)

Following packages are required to compile a project in your local machine:

- Texlive (or BasicTex if using MacOS)
- CMake
- Any Latex package manager
- Latex packages (see below)

It's also possible to use this template in overleaf.

## Quick start

### Import to overleaf

1. Download the following files and import them into your overleaf project:
    - `common/ikpKoeln.cls`
    - `common/ikpKolen.lua`
    - `template/main.tex`
    - `template/reference.bin`
  
2. Create a new folder `figures` in the project and copy `figures/TitleLogo.jpeg` to the folder. 

3. Activate LuaLatex in the setting.
    1. Go to `Menu -> Settings -> Compiler`
    2. Change the value from `pdfLatex` to `LuaLatex`

3. In the `main.tex` file, change
   ```latex
   \graphicspath{{../figures/}}
   ```
   to
   ```latex
   \graphicspath{{figures/}}
   ```

### Compile latex locally

1.  Create and initialize a new project:

    ```bash
    ./do_init
    ```

    After running this script, please give the necessary information, such as the project name, the server name and the shared picture folder. If the script finishes successfully, a new folder named after the project name will be created. Files like the main tex file, `main.tex` and `reference.bib` are also available inside the new folder.

2.  Compile the latex project:

    ```bash
    ./run
    ```

    This calls `cmake` commands to compile the Latex code. If the compilation is successful, the generated PDF file, `main.pdf`, will also be copied into the source folder.

## Required Latex Packages

- `utopia`
- `fourier`
- `greek-fontenc`
- `luacode`
- `luapackageloader`
- `biblatex`
- `biblatex-phys`
- `physics`
- `siunitx`

## Tips

### Adjust the gap among items

```latex
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item First item
    \item Second item
    \item Third item
\end{itemize}
```

This reduce the gap to 0.

### Item animation with transparency

```latex
\begin{enumerate}
    \setbeamercovered{transparent}
    \item<1-> First item
    \item<2-> Second item
    \item<3-> Third item
\end{enumerate}
```

### Display picture animation

```latex
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics<1>[width = 0.9\textwidth]{DPG2025/TimeDifference_0.png}%
    \includegraphics<2>[width = 0.9\textwidth]{DPG2025/TimeDifference_1.png}%
    \includegraphics<3>[width = 0.9\textwidth]{DPG2025/TimeDifference_2.png}%
\end{figure}
```

Important: The `%` is required to prevent the picture spuriously shifting the right.

## TODO list

- rsync with picture folder from the server
- Github CI to compile/save the pdf to the ikp server
- New theme
