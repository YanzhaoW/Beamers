# Presentation slides using Beamer/Latex

This repository contains my presentation sides for the past conferences and meetings. All slides are generated by the Beamer/Latex due to its superiority at:

- Macro configurations
- Better arrangement of texts and pictures
- Much better integration to git/github
- Works on all operating systems (Bye Bye Windows!)

Following packages are required to compile a project:

- Texlive (or BasicTex if using MacOS)
- CMake
- Any Latex package manager
- Latex packages (see below)

## Quick start

1.  Create and initialize a new project:

    ```bash
    ./do_init
    ```

    After running this script, please give the necessary information, such as the project name, the server name and the shared picture folder. If the script finishes successfully, a new folder named after the project name will be created. Files like the main tex file, `main.tex` and `reference.bib` are also available inside the new folder.

2.  Compile the latex project:

    ```bash
    ./run
    ```

    This calls `cmake` commands to compile the Latex code. If the compilation is successful, the generated PDF file, `main.pdf`, will also be copied into the source folder.

## Required Latex Packages

- `utopia`
- `fourier`
- `greek-fontenc`
- `luacode`
- `luapackageloader`
- `biblatex`
- `biblatex-phys`
- `physics`
- `siunitx`

## Tips

### Adjust the gap among items

```latex
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item First item
    \item Second item
    \item Third item
\end{itemize}
```

This reduce the gap to 0.

### Item animation with transparency

```latex
\begin{enumerate}
    \setbeamercovered{transparent}
    \item<1-> First item
    \item<2-> Second item
    \item<3-> Third item
\end{enumerate}
```

## TODO list

- rsync with picture folder from the server
- Github CI to compile/save the pdf to the ikp server
- New theme
